# A Curriculum for Technological Skill Acquisition

This repository was created to capture ideas related to Technological Skill Acquisition.

The acquisition and practice of technological skills encompasses all technologies and environments.

As knowledge, techniques, and understanding rapildy change -- so too should this repository.
All feedback is welcomed and encouraged.

The general pattern (need not be linear):

* Learn the basic vocabulary.
  * Define key terms.
  * Have a conversation using the terms.
  * "*What* are you learning?"
* Observe the application of the technology.
  * Observe a successful performance.
  * "What are the expressed behaviors of expertise?"
* Attempt a successful performance.
  * An exercise that incorporates immediate previous learning.
  * "What is the exercise that will confirm skill acquisiton? Can components of the exercise be practiced?"
* Analysis:
  * Consider the skill from its basic components.
  * "What is the system?" (Think deeply.)
* Synthesis:
  * Consider the skill applied in new ways.
  * "How can this system change other systems?" (Think broadly.)
* Evaluation:
  * "Is this good? Is this bad? What is good? What is bad?"
