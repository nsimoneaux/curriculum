# A Curriculum for Technological Skill Acquisition

This repository was created to capture ideas related to Technological Skill Acquisition.

The first modules were developed for an audience of adult learners in a classroom-lab setting.
Additionally, the lessons are developed to be delivered by an "expert" technologist to "learning" technologists.
All technologists are learning. In group settings, expertise may be divided among members. Leadership is shared.
Much expertise is available by way of the Internet, when not found locally.

The initial focus is "Digital Literacy".
The ability to use the Internet unlocks potential for infinite subsequent learning.
The acquisition and practice of technological skills should grow to encompass all technologies and environments.

As knowledge, techniques, and understanding rapildy change -- so too should this repository.
All feedback is welcomed and encouraged.

Using the educational framework provided by [Bloom’s Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy), each module aims to move the technologist toward mastery of the topic. Any modifications to methods or techniques are encouraged.

The general flow of a given lesson is constructed with the following aims:

* Inform the technologist about the basic vocabulary.
  * Define key terms.
  * Have a conversation using the terms.
  * "*What* are you learning?"
* Demonstrate the application of the technology.
  * A demonstration where technologists watch (focused observation).
  * A demonstration where technologists follow along (participant observation).
  * "What are the expressed behaviors of expertise?"
* Challenge the technologist to apply their new knowledge.
  * An exercise presented to the technologist that incorporates the previous immediate learning.
  * The challenge should have measurable success and failure states.
  * A high volume of failure will make for rapid acquisition of important data. *This is good.*
  * "What is the exercise that will confirm skill acquisiton? Can components of the exercise be practiced?"
* Encourage the technlogist to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate.
  * Analysis: Engaging with the new understanding, incorporating previous other knowledge.
    * Asking students questions about the challenge.
    * “Describe your process.”
    * "Why are you successful? Why are you failing? Think deeply."
  * Synthesis: Incorporating this new skill into practice.
    * Asking the students to create a new challenge that might develop further learning (deeper, or more broad, or both).
    * “How can you extend or refine this process?”
    * "What can you do to be more successful, or fail differently? Think broadly."
  * Evaluation: Observing practice and performance results for ideation of new success and failure.
    * "Now that knowledge has been gained, '*What* are you learning?'"
