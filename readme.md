# A Curriculum for Technologists

The general pattern (need not be linear):

* Learn the basic vocabulary.
  * Define key terms.
  * "*What* are you learning?"
* Observe the examples.
  * Observe a successful performance.
  * Observe unsuccessful performance.
  * "*Who* is using this? *How?*"
* Perform.
  * "What is the exercise that will confirm skill acquisition?"

* Analysis:
  * "What is the system?" (Think deeply.)
* Synthesis:
  * "How can this system change other systems; or, otherwise?" (Think broadly.)
* Evaluation:
  * "Is this good? Is this bad? What is good? What is bad?"
