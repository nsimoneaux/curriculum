# A Curriculum for Technological Skill Acquisition

This repository was created to capture ideas related to Technological Skill Acquisition.

The first modules were developed for an audience of adult learners in a computer lab classroom setting.
While the initial focus is "Digital Literacy", the acquisition and practice of technological skills should grow to encompass all technologies and environments.

As knowledge, techniques, and understanding rapildy change -- so too should this repository. All feedback is welcomed and encouraged.
