Using the educational framework provided by [Bloom’s Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy), each module aims to move students toward mastery of the topic.

The general flow of a given lesson is constructed with the following aims:

* Inform the students about the basic vocabulary needed to know about the topic.
  * A Vocabulary Exercise defining key terms.
  * A group conversation using the terms.
* Demonstrate the practical application of the topic from the perspective of the trainer to generate practical understanding of the topic.
  * A trainer-led demonstration where students watch.
  * A trainer-led demonstration where students follow along.
* An exercise that encourages the student to apply their new knowledge.
  * A challenge presented to the students that develops previous steps.
    * This challenge will be topic specific.
* An activity that encourages analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
  * Analysis: Encouraging the students to seek out further knowledge of the topic, or a variety of ways to accomplish a task.
    * Asking students questions about the previous challenge.
    * “Describe your process.”
  * Synthesis: Incorporating this new knowledge into other ideas or domains.
    * Asking the students to create a new challenge that might develop further learning (deeper, or more broad, or both).
    * “How can you extend or refine this process?”
  * Evaluation: Understanding the quality of an idea about the topic.
    * Asking students to consider their solutions based on other metrics.
    * “Is this the best, easiest, fastest, cheapest, … way to do what you did? How can you know?”
